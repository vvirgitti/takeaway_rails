### Takeaway restaurant
Revisited version of Makers Academy's Takeaway challenge.
Try it out here: [Takeaway Restaurant]()


#### Concept:
Welcome to the Golden Dragon takeaway restaurant!
As a client you can order from our menu, sign up and login. We will send you a text message when your order is confirmed with the delivery time.
As the owner, you can add new dishes to the menu through a dedicated interface.


#### Build with:
- Ruby on Rails
- Active Records
- Postgresql
- Devise
- HTML5
- CSS
- Twilio API


#### Features:
- Customer can sign up, log in and log out
- Customer can order food by adding dishes to their basket
- Order's total is calculated automatically, based on price and quantities
- Customer receives a text message when order is confirmed, with delivery time
- Owner can add, delete or update a dish to the menu - the menu (and the dishes) is entirely saved in a database


#### Future iterations:
- Interface for the customer to keep track of past orders
- Add payment functionality (Mastercard API)
